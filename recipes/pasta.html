        <h1>Penne Pasta</h1>

        <h1>Description</h1>
        <p>My favorite food is penne pasta. As I make this favorite dish, I can feel the last dry uncooked noodle of penne pasta fall off the palm of my hand into a boiling pot of water. 
            Once the pasta is cooked, the penne is drained and steam rises from the hot moist noodles. The penne pasta noodles that I like are slightly soft and are ready for seasoning and 
            flavoring with additional ingredients to appeal to the eyes and taste buds of the consumer.</p>
        <p>In looking at this amazing pasta dish, I can see the linear style pasta noodles that have come out of the box. I pour out the long penne noodles into the boiling water to cook for several minutes. Depending on the preference of the eater, one can cook the pasta al-dente or fully cooked to their individual perfection. 
         I can see the pasta penne noodles pattern that is striated lines parallel to each other on each single noodle. While waiting for the pasta to cook, I prepare the ingredients to complement the penne pasta and I stir the reddish tomato paste for the final addition.

        <p>While preparing this penne pasta, I move on to the cheese continuing to be busy as the water comes to a boil. I rub the block of Parmesan cheese on to a grater and hear the shaved cheese strands landing on a plate. When I hear the bubbly sounds come from the pot of boiling water, I know the water has come to a boil and it is time to begin adding the pasta. As the pasta cooks I steam vegetables to add to the pasta. The pasta is stirred in the pot once and a while so penne pasta noodles donâ€™t stick to the bottom of the pot. I hear the squishy sounds of the penne noodle as the stirring spoon rubs noodles up against the inner walls of the pot. I can hear the noisy sounds of the spoon clinging against the pan as I stir the tomato sauce.

            The best part of preparing my lovely plate is the smell. I smell the seasoned sauce that has herbs of basil, mushroom, and additional vegetables and spices. The grated Parmesan makes it smell fresh and cheesy. The steam of the pasta dish and the vegetables smell delicious.</p>
